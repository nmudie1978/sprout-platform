## Sprout Helps Young People Take Their First Steps Into Work

Sprout is a platform designed for young people in Norway, aged 16 to 20, who want to earn money, gain experience, and understand what the working world has to offer.

We connect youth with small, local jobs — things like helping a neighbour move furniture, assisting at a community event, or doing seasonal work for a local business. These are real opportunities to earn, learn responsibility, and build confidence.

But Sprout is more than a job board. It's a place to explore what different careers look like, what skills they require, and how today's choices connect to tomorrow's possibilities.

## The Problem Sprout Exists to Solve

Finding your first job is harder than it used to be.

Many young people want to work but don't know where to start. Traditional job boards are designed for adults with CVs and experience. Asking around feels awkward. And for parents, there's often uncertainty about who their child is actually working for.

At the same time, the world of work is changing quickly. New roles are emerging. Old ones are disappearing. Young people hear about AI, automation, and "skills of the future" — but rarely get a clear picture of what any of it means for them.

Sprout exists to solve both problems: help young people find safe, appropriate work today, and help them understand the landscape of work they're growing into.

## Who Sprout Is For

### Young People (16–20)

Sprout is built for you. Whether you want to earn some extra money, try different types of work, or just figure out what interests you — this is your space to explore at your own pace.

### Parents and Guardians

Sprout is designed with your peace of mind in mind. You can see who is offering work, understand how we verify adults, and trust that the platform doesn't put your child in uncomfortable situations. We've made deliberate design choices to reduce risk and increase transparency.

### Employers and Job Posters

If you're an adult looking to hire young people for appropriate tasks — whether you're a local business, a neighbour, or an organisation — Sprout gives you a straightforward way to connect with motivated youth. You'll go through identity verification, and the platform keeps communication structured and appropriate.

## What Sprout Provides

### A Simple Way to Find Local Work

Young people can browse jobs posted in their area — tasks that match their age, availability, and interests. These might be one-time gigs, weekend work, or short-term projects. Everything is local, manageable, and designed for people just starting out.

### A Way to Earn Money on Your Own Terms

Sprout doesn't handle payments or take a cut. When you complete a job, you're paid directly by the person who hired you, just like any normal work arrangement. This keeps things simple and puts you in control of your earnings.

### Learning About Career Paths

Beyond individual jobs, Sprout helps you understand what's out there. What does a logistics coordinator actually do? What skills does a UX designer need? What certifications open doors in healthcare? What's the typical salary range for a software developer in Norway?

You can explore different industries, read about real roles, and start to see how short-term work today might connect to longer-term interests.

### Understanding the Job Market

The way people work is changing. Some jobs are growing. Others are shrinking. New skills are becoming valuable. Sprout helps you see these patterns — not to overwhelm you, but to help you make informed choices about what to learn and where to focus.

### Building a Record of Experience

As you complete jobs on Sprout, you build a profile. Employers can leave feedback. You can describe what you've done. Over time, this becomes a record of your reliability, your skills, and your growth — useful for future opportunities, whether on Sprout or elsewhere.

### A One-Stop Place to Grow

Sprout brings together what young people actually need: a way to earn, a way to learn, and a way to prepare. Instead of scattered information and confusing job boards, everything is in one place — designed specifically for your stage of life.

## Safety and Trust – Built In From Day One

Safety isn't an add-on at Sprout. It's a core design principle that shapes every feature we build. We've made deliberate choices to create an environment where young people can participate confidently and parents can feel reassured.

### Why We Take This Seriously

Young people deserve a platform that respects their vulnerability while supporting their independence. Parents deserve to know that a platform their child uses has thought carefully about risk. We've designed Sprout to reduce opportunities for misuse, pressure, or inappropriate contact.

### Identity Verification for Adults

Every adult who posts a job on Sprout must verify their identity using BankID. This means we know who they are. It creates accountability and removes the anonymity that bad actors rely on. If someone behaves inappropriately, they can be identified and removed.

### Youth Sign-Up Without BankID

We know that not all young people have BankID. That's why youth can sign up using Vipps or other age-appropriate verification methods. This makes the platform accessible while still confirming that users are who they say they are.

### Structured Communication

Sprout does not have free-text chat. Communication between youth and employers happens through structured messages — things like confirming availability, agreeing on details, or asking specific questions. This design choice reduces the risk of grooming, inappropriate conversation, or pressure. It keeps interactions focused on work.

### No Money Handling

Sprout does not process payments. We don't hold funds, take fees, or facilitate transactions. All payment happens directly between the young person and the employer, outside the platform. This keeps things simple and removes financial complexity from the platform itself.

### Clear Reporting and Blocking

If something feels wrong, users can report it immediately. Blocking is simple and effective. We review reports seriously and take action when needed. The goal is an environment where problems are easy to flag and quick to address.

### Designed to Prevent, Not Just React

Many platforms add safety features after problems occur. We've built Sprout with prevention in mind from the start. Structured communication, verified identities, and transparent job postings all work together to create an environment where harmful behaviour is difficult to initiate and easy to detect.

## The World of Work Is Changing

Young people today are entering a job market that looks different from the one their parents knew.

Artificial intelligence is changing how many jobs are done. Some roles are disappearing. Others are emerging. Skills that were once optional — like digital literacy, adaptability, and communication — are now essential almost everywhere.

At the same time, traditional career paths are less linear. People change jobs more often. Freelance and project-based work is more common. The idea of one career for life is largely gone.

This isn't something to fear, but it is something to understand. Sprout helps young people see these changes clearly — not as abstract trends, but as real information about real roles, skills, and opportunities.

---

## Our Philosophy

We believe that young people are capable, curious, and ready to contribute. They don't need to be protected from work — they need access to appropriate work in a safe environment.

We believe parents want to support their children's independence, not control it. They need enough information to feel confident, not surveillance tools that undermine trust.

We believe that earning money, meeting expectations, and being part of something useful are valuable experiences. They build confidence, responsibility, and self-knowledge in ways that classrooms alone cannot.

Sprout exists to make these experiences accessible, safe, and connected to a broader understanding of what work can be.

---

## Our Long-Term Goal

Sprout's goal is to become the trusted starting point for young people entering the world of work in Norway.

Not a gig economy platform. Not a career advice site. Something more complete: a place where young people can earn, learn, explore, and grow — with safety and trust built into every interaction.

We want every young person who uses Sprout to feel more confident, more informed, and more prepared for whatever comes next.
