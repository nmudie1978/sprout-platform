## Quick Guide (MicroGuideCard) - Added 2026-01-20

**Status:** UNTESTED

**Files:**
- `src/components/careers/MicroGuideCard.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/career-detail-sheet.tsx` (modified)

**Description:**
Placeholder AI Quick Guide component that appears in the "Learn More" career detail view. Shows structured guidance (reality check, tips, common mistake) based on job category.

**What to test:**
- [ ] Quick Guide appears in CareerDetailSheet when clicking "Learn More"
- [ ] Content matches job category (retail, hospitality, delivery, tech, childcare)
- [ ] Falls back to "general" guide for unmatched careers
- [ ] Mobile responsive display
- [ ] Dark mode styling
- [ ] Disclaimer text displays correctly
